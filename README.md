# Ï€ Stream (pi_calc.py)

**Endless digits of Ï€ (Pi), calculated and streamed live to disk with a clean terminal HUD.**

This project is a Python script that continuously generates digits of Ï€ using the Rabinowitzâ€“Wagon spigot algorithm and saves them into a text file.  
Itâ€™s built to run indefinitely, checkpointing state along the way so it can **resume after crashes or power outages** without losing progress.

## âœ¨ Features
- **Resumable** â†’ Saves state to a JSON file; restarts exactly where it left off.
- **Terminal HUD** â†’ Displays live stats (digits written, rate, file size, free disk, CPU/RAM usage).
- **Safe writing** â†’ Periodic checkpoints and fsyncs protect against data loss.
- **Disk safety** â†’ Option to pause if free disk space falls below a threshold.
- **Configurable** â†’ Adjust checkpoint frequency, HUD refresh interval, line width in output, etc.
- **Portable** â†’ Defaults to the folder you run it from (or specify `--out`).

## ðŸ›  Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Optional: [`psutil`](https://pypi.org/project/psutil/) for CPU/RAM monitoring in the HUD

Install psutil with:
```bash
pip install psutil
